  "headline": "Industrial Painting & Surface Prep Marketing System",
  "subheadline": "A phased approach to dominate Hudson Valley search results for industrial painting, propane tank restoration, and equipment refinishing—starting with SEO, scaling with Google Ads in spring.",

  "situationPoints": [
    "Built successful business through word-of-mouth and referrals, but want to control growth instead of waiting for the phone to ring",
    "Sell a lot of work because of painting services, but website only showcases sandblasting—prospects can't see full capabilities",
    "Past Google Ads brought in jobs, but turned everything off this year due to being overwhelmed with work and employee issues",
    "Winter is slow season (can't work in extreme cold), need to use this time strategically to prepare for spring",
    "Want to focus on commercial work: propane tanks, truck frames, trailers, equipment restoration—high-value jobs, not residential work"
  ],

  "solutionOverview": "We're taking a seasonal approach that works with your business cycle. Phase 1 (January-March) focuses on getting your website dialed in and building organic SEO visibility during the slow winter months. This gives us time to add dedicated painting service pages, showcase your best projects, and start ranking for your target keywords. Phase 2 (Spring) layers in Google Ads to capture high-intent industrial painting searches right when your busy season kicks in and you're ready to handle the volume.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start seeing results?",
      "answer": "SEO results typically take 60-90 days to build momentum. You'll see ranking improvements within the first month, but meaningful organic traffic usually appears in months 2-3. Google Ads leads start flowing within 14 days of launch in spring."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why start with SEO instead of just running ads?",
      "answer": "Winter is your slow season, making it the perfect time to build your organic foundation without the pressure of needing immediate leads. By spring, you'll have both SEO momentum and Google Ads working together—maximizing visibility when you need it most."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the Google Ads don't work in spring?",
      "answer": "If you meet the agreed stipulations and we don't deliver at least 10 qualified opportunities in 90 days, we refund 100% of our Google Ads management fees for that period."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I just do SEO without adding Google Ads later?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can stay SEO-only if you prefer. Google Ads is optional and only recommended when you're ready to scale volume during peak season."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from us to make this successful?",
      "answer": "High-quality photos of your best industrial painting work (propane tanks, truck frames, equipment). Fast follow-up on leads (within 4 hours). Monthly check-ins to review what's working."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we pause or cancel?",
      "answer": "After the initial 3-month SEO build phase, it's month-to-month with no long contracts. You stay because the system produces opportunities and revenue."
