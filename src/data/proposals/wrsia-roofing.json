  "situationPoints": [
    "You've built a strong reputation in commercial roofing through proactive prospecting, warranty work, and word-of-mouth in Des Moines",
    "Your team is constantly looking for opportunities—everyone has their antennas up—but you're ready for a steadier, more predictable flow of leads",
    "You're moving away from waiting for storms, leaks, or emergencies to bring in work—you want to be proactive",
    "Your approach is different: you're not chasing one-and-done reroofs. You build long-term relationships through leak calls, inspections, and maintenance programs",
    "You're planning to grow—adding a service team and discussing a third production crew—but you need the pipeline to support that expansion"

  "solutionOverview": "We leverage Google Ads to put WRSIA in front of commercial property owners and facility managers at the exact moment they're searching for leak repairs, roof inspections, and commercial roofing services in the Des Moines area. Every inquiry is captured, qualified, and logged so you can focus on building the relationships that lead to maintenance contracts and full reroofs.",
