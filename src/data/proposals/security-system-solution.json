  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start seeing leads?",
      "answer": "Most clients see their first leads within 14 days as campaigns go live. The full 60-day build and proof phase is about stabilizing volume, improving quality, and pushing toward the agreed opportunity target."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if it doesn't work?",
      "answer": "If you meet the agreed stipulations and we don't deliver the promised volume of sales-ready opportunities, our guarantee applies and we refund 100% of our management fee for that period."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from us to make this successful?",
      "answer": "Respond to leads fast, dedicate time each day to nurture opportunities, and follow up on every opportunity until you get a clear yes/no."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time does this require from our team?",
      "answer": "Outside of onboarding and a simple review rhythm, your time investment is minimal. You focus on calls and closing; we handle the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we pause or cancel?",
      "answer": "After the initial 60-day build and proof phase, it's month-to-month with no long contracts. You stay because the engine produces opportunities and revenue."
