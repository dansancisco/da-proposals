  "faqs": [
    {

    {
      "question": "What if the leads aren't qualified?",
      "answer": "Every lead goes through our qualification process before reaching you. If a lead doesn't meet the agreed criteria, we don't count it and we don't charge for it. Simple."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this different from other agencies I've tried?",
      "answer": "Most agencies just run ads and send you form fills. We qualify every lead, transfer calls live during business hours, and only count opportunities that match your criteria. We're accountable to outcomes, not activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum commitment?",
      "answer": "We require a 90-day minimum commitment. It takes time to build momentum and optimize campaigns. After 90 days, the engagement is month-to-month."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I see the ads and landing pages before they go live?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You'll approve all creative and messaging before anything goes live. We want you confident in how your brand is being represented."
