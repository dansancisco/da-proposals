  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start seeing opportunities?",

      "question": "What makes these sales-ready opportunities?",
      "answer": "Every opportunity comes from someone actively searching for paving services—they have a need right now. We record all calls so you can see the quality and quantity coming in."

      "question": "What if the campaigns don't work?",

    {
      "question": "What do you need from us?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can we pause or cancel?",
      "answer": "After the initial 60-day period, it's month-to-month. No long contracts. You stay because the phone keeps ringing with qualified opportunities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum commitment?",
      "answer": "60 days at $5,000/month total ($1,500 management + $3,500 ad spend). This gives us enough data to optimize and prove the ROI."
