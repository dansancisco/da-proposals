  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start seeing leads?",
      "answer": "Most clients see their first calls within 7-14 days of campaign launch. The first month is about learning which keywords convert best; results compound from there."

    {
      "question": "What makes these leads qualified?",
      "answer": "Every lead comes from someone actively searching for paving services. They have a need right now. We also record calls so you can hear the context before calling back."

    {
      "question": "What if the campaigns don't work?",
      "answer": "If we don't deliver 40 qualified opportunities in 60 days while you meet the agreed conditions, we refund 100% of our management fees. We only win when you win."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from us?",
      "answer": "Fast follow-up on leads (within 4 hours). Tracking outcomes so we know which leads turned into jobs. Monthly check-ins to review performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we pause or cancel?",
      "answer": "After the initial 60-day period, it's month-to-month. No long contracts. You stay because the phone keeps ringing with qualified opportunities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum commitment?",
      "answer": "60 days at $5,000/month total ($1,500 management + $3,500 ad spend). This gives us enough data to optimize and prove the ROI."
